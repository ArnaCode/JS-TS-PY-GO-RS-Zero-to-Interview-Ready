# 000 - Data Types

Welcome to the **Data Types** lessons! ðŸŽ‰ This is the first step in our journey to mastering programming across five powerful languages: **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, **Go**, and **Rust**. If you're new to programming or just brushing up, you're in the right place.

---

## Objective

In this section, we'll cover:

- **What are data types?**
- **Introduction to primitive data types**
- **How variables are declared in each language**
- **Types in dynamic vs static languages**

This foundational understanding will set you up for success in tackling coding challenges with confidence.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this section, you will:

1. Understand the concept of data types and their importance in programming.
2. Be able to differentiate between dynamic and static typing.
3. Know how to declare and use variables in:
   - JavaScript
   - TypeScript
   - Python
   - Go
   - Rust

## How to Use This Section

1. **Read the examples** for each language to understand variable declaration and data types.
2. **Experiment** by creating variables in your preferred language.
3. **Compare** how the same task is accomplished across languages.
